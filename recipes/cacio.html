    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that we have made in our family for many years--everyone loves it. It's a very basic and easy variation on mac 'n cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 Â¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      </ul>  
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve. Drain spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.</li>
        </ol>
